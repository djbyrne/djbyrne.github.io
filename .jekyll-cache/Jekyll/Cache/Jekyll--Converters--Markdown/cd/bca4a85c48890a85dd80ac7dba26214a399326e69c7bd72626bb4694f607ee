I"`<p>Welcome to my blog! My name’s Donal. I’m passionate about AI, gaming, anime, comics and all things nerdy. During the day
(and some nights) I work as a Machine Learning (ML) Engineer for Xperi’s CoreML team. Here I get to work on the practical 
implementation and design of state of the art machine learning for a range of problem domains.</p>
