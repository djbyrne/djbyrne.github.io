I"R<p>Welcome to my blog! My name’s Donal. I’m passionate about AI, gaming, anime, comics and all things nerdy. During the day
(and some nights) I work as a Machine Learning (ML) Engineer for Xperi’s CoreML team. Here I get to work on the practical 
implementation and design of state of the art machine learning for a range of problem domains.</p>

<p>In my spare time I am learning as much as I can about ML, specifically Reinforcment Learning. I push most of my RL
side projects to my github and I like to write a few articles about what im working on and learning, when time permits. 
When I’m not working on ML, I am usually drawing, writing or crafting things with my fiance for our weekly
Dungeons and Dragons game.</p>

<p>The goal of this blog is to share the stuff that I think people might find useful or interesting. This mainly consists
of the topics that I am currently learning and the mistakes (as well as the odd success) I have made along the way.</p>

<p>If you want to reach out feel free to contact me through my <a href="donaljbyrne@me.com">email</a> or social media below.</p>
