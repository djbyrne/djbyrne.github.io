I started working on ML in the final year of my bachelors degree (that was about two years ago). 
We didn't have a specific AI course so I set out to 
teach myself. Luckily, there is an abundance of free and readily available resources online. This is kind of a double
edged sword. Sure, all the information you need is there at the click of a google search, but there is an overwhelmingly
large amount of information out there. Not only is it difficult to figure out what topic to focus on or learn first, but
even when you do settle on a specific topic, there is still a vast amount of information out there ranging in quality,
complexity and even correctness.

I fell into the obvious, yet common, trap of skipping ahead to the cool stuff. Sure I took the time to get up to speed 
on deep learning basics, but I focused more on getting things running, rather than actually understanding why they work.
After a few weeks I had my incredibly impressive "Cat-Dog" classifier working and feeling like a mad scientist who just
built their first death-ray, I was confident in my ability to tackle my real goal, Reinforcement Learning. 

I followed a similar approach that I took with the basics of deep learning. I found a Udemy course on RL, sourced some 
good blog posts and skimmed through the DQN paper. With a combination of working from examples, trial and error,
stubbornness and coffee, I learned enough to understand the DQN algorithm at a sufficient level to build a pretty good
DOOM agent that went on to be the core of my bachelors thesis.

The project went well and I graduate top of my class. I even managed to land a job working as a graduate ML engineer at
Jaguar Land Rover. Yep, I felt pretty good about my capabilities at this point. It was only a matter of time before I 
created fully sentient AI to replace the real players in my D&D game (The AI wouldn't spend 4 hours role playing dress
shopping for a side quest involving a royal banquet). However, reality finally caught up to me. There were foundational
gaps in my ML knowledge and I quickly realised that I could only get so far with the high level understanding of the 
foundations. My progress slowed and I struggled to get a deeper understanding of more state of the art algorithms. On 
top of that I found out that my coding standards were trash. In college you're just happy that your coding assingment 
runs 9/10 times and that you managed to hand it in only 1 day after the deadline. Needless to say, I picked up some bad 
habbits. 

After having a small existential crisis at the ripe old age of 23, I decided I needed to go back and put time into
understanding the basics of ML and get my software engineering skills up to industry standards. This was slow process as 
working a full time job meant less time for extra study than I was used to in college. 

I have spent the last two years or so working on the gaps in my skills. I am by no means finished (there is so much 
I dont understand about so many things that it makes me sweat from my eyes) but I am now able to stand behind my work
and knowledge. The bulk of my time has been spent on foundation skills, which means I haven't been able to put much time into 
my real passion, Reinforcement Learning. So now, I am committing my time to go from the novice I was in college to an RL
Expert!

Expert may be a little ambitious, but its good to have goals. Lets dial it back a bit. I am setting myself the goal of 
becoming as proficient in RL as I can before the end of 2020. I seriously doubt I will reach expert level by then as it 
is currently the 21st June, but maybe something along the lines of journeyman status.

Currently there are 194 days left in the year, which is roughly 27 weeks. My goal is to spend at least 1 hour a day 
Mon-Fri and at least 6 hours over Sat-Sun. This brings me to ~11 hours a week of study. This leaves 297 hours of study before years end. Thats 
not a lot of time (Dont get me wrong, I wont this apocolyptic year to end as quickly as possible and find the guy that
accidently opened Pandoras box) but its enough to make a sizable increase in my skills and knowledge.
